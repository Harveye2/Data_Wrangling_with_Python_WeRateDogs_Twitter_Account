    "The data used for the WeRateDogs Twitter Account Analysis Report was gathered from three different sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The 'twitter_archive_enhanced.csv' file, which was available for manual download.  This file contained information on the tweet ID's, text, dog rating, dog stage etc. This file was opened in a dataframe entitled 'twitter_archive'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The 'image_predictions.tsv' file, which was downloaded programmaticaly, using the Requests library, from Udacity's server. This file contained information on the breed of dog (or other object, animal) that was predicted from the image in each tweet using neural networks.  This file was opened in a dataframe entitled 'image_predictions'.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The 'tweet_json.txt' file, which was obtained by quering the Twitter API, using the tweet IDs from the 'twitter_archive_enhanced.csv' file.  However, 11 errors were obtained during this process, with error code: 144. This error code indicates that no status was found with that ID number, and it corresponds with HTTP 404: The requested Tweet ID is not found (if it existed, it was probably deleted).  The code was run again in an attempt to gather the data for the 11 tweet_id's in the tweet_error list, however the same error messages were received.  Using the Tweepy library, JSON data for 2345 tweets was downloaded and stored in the 'tweet_json.txt' file.  This file contained information about each tweet's retweet count and favorite (\"like\") count, and was opened in a dataframe entitled 'df_json'.\n"

According to the Tweet Data Dictionary (https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/data-dictionary/overview/tweet-object), 'in_reply_to_status_id' column contains the integer representation of the original Tweet’s ID, and indicates that the represented Tweet in this row is a reply. Also, the 'in_reply_to_user_id' contains the integer representation of the original Tweet’s author ID (this will not necessarily always be the user directly mentioned in the Tweet). Therefore, the rows in the twitter_archive table that contain non-null values in the 'in_reply_to_status_id' and 'in_reply_to_user_id', show that these tweets are a reply to another tweet.
